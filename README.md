 * In each new worker folder run `python3 main.py` and login
 * If you get errors install dependencies from `requirement.txt`
 * Go to `containers.py` and replace path `/home/botfarm/tele-worker/workers` with your path to workers folder
 * Run `sudo python3 containers.py` and create container for each worker

    print('mkdir ' + w_path)
    shutil.copytree("working/", w_path, ignore=shutil.ignore_patterns('*.pyc', 'tmp*'))
    with open(w_path + '/config.json', 'w') as outfile:
        json.dump(worker, outfile)
 ```
 * Command `python3 workers.py` will generate workers

  driver = WebDriver(executable_path=r'yourpathtodriver\geckodriver.exe',options=self.opts)
  self.browser = driver
 ```
 * After first start in `simulator.py` replace code on
 ```
 driver = WebDriver(options=self.opts)
 self.browser = driver
 ```
 * In each new worker folder run `python3 main.py` and login
